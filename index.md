This full day workshop explores Human Data Interaction challenges, specifically in information retrieval for data on the web. We want to stimulate an interdisciplinary discussion around opportunities to improve the discovery of structured and semi-structured data, independent of data formats and domain specific applications. We plan this to be the first of a series of similar workshops which bring together communities interested in making the web of data more discoverable, easier to search and more user friendly.

# [](#topics)Topics and Themes

The workshop proposes a multidisciplinary discussion on the following themes, with the focus on RDF, CSV, JSON and other structured and semi-structured data sets:

*	Dataset retrieval
*	Data management
*	Search results presentation for datasets
*	Semantic search
*	Data summarisation
*	Data wrangling
*	Data exploration
*	Automated approaches to data exploration
*	Evaluation of dataset search tools and algorithms
*	Data fusion and Information integration
*	Human data interaction
*	Information seeking behaviour
*	Combining and integrating digital heterogeneous datasets
*	Usability of data portals / data discovery tools
*	Decentralized and distributed architectures and algorithms in data search
*	Data retrieval in digital libraries
*	Indexing, searching and profiling approaches
*	Data quality metrics
*	Approaches to personalisation in dataset search

We are interested in contributions using a variety of methods. This can include e.g. user studies, lab experiments, system based evaluation, but also experiments using gamification and crowdsourcing.

# [](#format)Workshop Format

The workshop will span a full day, commencing with a keynote and closing with focused discussion triggered by statements of interest from a core set of speakers. During the workshop, we will have brief presentations of short papers submitted to the workshop as well as a working session. Paper presentations will follow a lightning talk format where most of the time will be dedicated to questions and comments from the audience. For the working sessions the audience will be invited to join roundtables on different topics, defined based on accepted submissions. Authors will be encouraged to submit papers whose length is proportional to their contribution; a maximum number of 5 pages in ACM format is considered appropriate for the topic and aims of the workshop. We are expecting to accept up to 12 papers.

# [](#schedule)Tentative Schedule

Following an introduction by the organisers, the workshop will be opened by a keynote by a distinguished practitioner who can  give  the participants an overview of recent developments around data search. The rest of the morning will involve paper presentation, questions and discussions. For the afternoon we expect to organise 2 to 4 round tables around topics stemming from statements of interest proposed by the authors of accepted papers. Topics will be published on the website on the day of the workshop, the audience will be invited to join one of the round tables. The day will be wrapped up with a summary of discussions from the roundtables, collecting calls for action for future activities and a short reflection on the workshop.
